# Golang
I really enjoy using this repository to practice my skillset in Golang and acquire fresh knowledge.

1) BRANCH: basic-go
    It contains the basic practice done while learning go to get familiar with go signatures and to know approaches to do the stuff in go.
   
3) BRANCH: advanced-go
    It contains the advanced practice done like DB connection & calls,(Postgresql, Redis), go-cloak to understand the user management by keycloak...etc.
